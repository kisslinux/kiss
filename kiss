    # This function is called once when needed to cache the

    # and should never leave the package manager's process.
    #
    # This behavior is needed as there is no POSIX shell method
    # of running a shell function as a different user. We can't
    # selectively lower or raise permissions in a seamless way
    # through "normal" means.
    #
    # Root is only needed when installing/removing packages whereas
    # non-root permissions are needed in countless places throughout.
    #
    # This is the only *workable* solution to 1) not run the entire
    # package manager as root and 2) avoid prompting for password
    # before, during and after builds numerous times.
    #
    # NOTE: Careful consideration has been taken in regards to this
    #       change and I would have loved an inconspicuous solution
    #       to this problem... but it doesn't exist.

    # command allows you to input a password via stdin. To hide
    # the prompt, the command's output is sent to '/dev/tty'
    # and the output of 'su' is sent to '/dev/null'.

    # The code below uses the most secure method of sending
    # data over stdin based on what is available in the system.
    #
    # The great debate: Use a heredoc or echo+pipe for password
    # input over stdin? Time to explain.
    #
    # 1) 'printf | cmd' is the most secure IF 'printf' is built
    #    into the shell and NOT an external command. When 'printf'
    #    is external, the password WILL be leaked over '/proc'.
    #
    #    Safe shells here are anything with a builtin 'printf',
    #    'ash', 'dash', 'bash' and most other shells.
    #
    # 2) Using a heredoc is as secure as the above method (when
    #    builtin) IF and only IF the user's shell implements
    #    heredocs WITHOUT the use of temporary files (See bash!).
    #
    #    When using heredocs and a temporary file the risk is a
    #    tiny window in which the input is available inside of
    #    a temporary file.
    #
    #    'ash' and 'dash' are safe here, 'bash' is not ('bash'
    #    falls under (1) however).
    #
    # Which is best? (order is best to worst)
    #
    # 1) builtin 'printf'.
    # 2) heredocs with no temporary file.
    # 3) heredocs with a temporary file.
    #
