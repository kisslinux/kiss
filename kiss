    # Package installation works similarly to the method used by Slackware in
    # some of their tooling. It's not the obvious solution to the problem,
    # however it is the best solution at this given time.
    #
    # When an installation is an update to an existing package, instead of
    # removing the old version first we do something different.
    #
    # The new version is installed overwriting any files which it has in
    # common with the previously installed version of the package.
    #
    # A "diff" is then generated between the old and new versions and contains
    # any files existing in the old version but not the new version.
    #
    # The package manager then goes and removes these files which leaves us
    # with the new package version in the file system and all traces of the
    # old version gone.
    #
    # For good measure the package manager will then install the new package
    # an additional time. This is to ensure that the above diff didn't contain
    # anything incorrect.

    # create a window in which there is no access to all of its utilities to
